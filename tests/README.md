# Wine tests for the Haiku patches

Small Windows programs that check the behaviour copy protection depends on. Each one prints
PASS or FAIL, or what it found. Build them on any machine with a MinGW-w64 cross compiler (the
build line is at the top of each file), then run them with `wine` on Haiku. For comparison,
run them on Linux or Windows too.

| Test | Checks | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `traptest.c` | A single step (trap flag) and an `int3` reach a vectored exception handler. | A kernel that delivers user traps as SIGTRAP |
| `hwbptest.c` | Hardware breakpoints set with `SetThreadContext`: on the current thread, on another suspended thread, and a write watchpoint. | Patch 17 and a kernel with `THREAD_SET_DEBUG_REGISTERS` |
| `probetest.c` + `probe.S` | PACE's breakpoint probe, copied instruction for instruction: every call must trap, after sleeps, exceptions, threads, file I/O, a guard page, crypto and suspension by another thread. Also prints the DR6 value the program reads back (Windows: `0xffff0fff`). | Same as `hwbptest` |
| `loadvst.c` | Loads a VST3 the way a plug-in host does (`LoadLibraryW`, then `GetPluginFactory`), so licence checks in `DllMain` can be tested without a DAW. | A VST3 plug-in |
| `voltest.c` | What `GetDriveType` and `GetVolumeInformation` return for drive roots. | — |

`probetest` accepts part of an activity name to run only that one, for example
`wine probetest.exe suspended`. On Linux it is slow (several minutes), because Wine sets debug
registers there through ptrace.
