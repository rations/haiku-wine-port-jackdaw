# Probes

Small standalone programs that establish the facts
[OSMESA-GL-PLAN.md](../OSMESA-GL-PLAN.md) is built on. They are the reason the plan chose OSMesa
over EGL and over Vulkan/DXVK — rerun them before trusting any of those conclusions on a
different Haiku revision or Mesa version.

Build and run on the Haiku target:

| Probe | Build | Establishes |
|---|---|---|
| `osprobe.c` | `cc osprobe.c -o osprobe -lOSMesa` | **The plan's foundation.** OSMesa gives headless desktop GL with no window: `OSMesaCreateContextAttribs` + `OSMesaMakeCurrent` into a malloc'd RGBA8 buffer yields GL 4.5 compat / llvmpipe and renders a correct frame. Plan §1. |
| `eglprobe.c` | `cc eglprobe.c -o eglprobe -lEGL -lGL` | **The dead end that ruled out EGL.** Surfaceless/device EGL is advertised as a *client* extension but `eglInitialize` fails with `EGL_NOT_INITIALIZED`, and there is no Wayland EGL platform at all — so `winewayland.drv`'s existing EGL path can never work on Haiku. Plan §1. |
| `vkenum.c` | `cc vkenum.c -o vkenum -lvulkan` | Vulkan instance/device enumeration. |
| `vkext.c` | `cc vkext.c -o vkext -lvulkan` | **The dead end that ruled out DXVK.** The Vulkan loader exposes no surface extensions, so there is no WSI to present through. Plan §7. |
| `gltest.c` | winegcc, run under Wine | Gate 2 of the plan's test plan (§5): a Win32 app creating a GL context *through Wine*. Under the OSMesa backend it should print llvmpipe 4.5 with no `Failed to find a suitable pixel format`. This is the gate that is not yet green. |
