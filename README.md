# haiku-wine-port

Haiku patches for **Wine 11.19**, packaged as a HaikuPorts port. They exist so that
[vstbridge-haiku](https://github.com/rations/vstbridge-haiku) can run **Windows VST2 and VST3
plug-ins** inside [jackDAW-haiku](https://github.com/rations/jackDAW-haiku) — the stock
HaikuPorts Wine package is missing the Haiku fixes the bridge depends on.

**This repository is the source of truth for these patches.** They were offered upstream and
declined (HaikuPorts does not accept AI-assisted contributions), so they are maintained here
instead. Nothing else is authoritative — not the build machine, not any working tree. See
[Where things live](#where-things-live).

The repo carries no Wine sources, only the recipe and the patchsets (~450 KB). `haikuporter`
downloads the upstream tarball (checksum pinned in the recipe) and applies the patchset to it.

## The patchset

Seventeen patches. **1–4 are upstream HaikuPorts'**, with original authorship preserved in each
`From:` line. **5–17 are local.**

| # | Patch | Author | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add Wayland input header | X512 | upstream |
| 2 | 11.8 patches | X512 | upstream — the bulk of the Haiku port. Rebased onto 11.19 with two conflicts resolved; the rebase note is in the commit body. |
| 3 | Disable Bluetooth on Beta 5 | Peppersawce | upstream |
| 4 | Opensound support | Ken Mays | upstream — audio |
| 5 | Run static initializers in Winelib modules on Haiku | local | Winelib modules never ran their C++ static constructors. vstbridge's Wine host is a C++ Winelib module, so without this it starts with uninitialised globals. **This is the essential one.** |
| 6 | Do not block in the SIGSEGV handler on Haiku | local | The port's handler ended in a blocking `fgetc(stdin)` so a developer could inspect the fault. Anything without a usable stdin — a DAW, any GUI app, anything from the Deskbar — hung there instead of letting Wine's handler recover. |
| 7 | loader: find the loader path via `find_path()` on Haiku | local | Haiku has no `/proc`, so `get_self_exe()` returned NULL and the loader resolved `argv[0]` relative to the current directory — a bare `wine` from `PATH` failed with `could not load ntdll.so`. Fixed with `find_path(B_FIND_PATH_IMAGE_PATH)`. |
| 8 | winewayland: add OSMesa software OpenGL backend for Haiku | local | Gives Wine a software GL backend (OSMesa/llvmpipe) so wined3d can create a device and D3D-drawn plug-in editors can render — **without it those editors do not display at all**. Haiku's Mesa has no DRI swrast and no Wayland EGL platform, so `winewayland.drv`'s existing EGL path can never initialize there. Ported to Wine 11.19's GL driver interface; see the status below. |
| 9 | dxgi: wait for a refresh interval in `IDXGIOutput::WaitForVBlank()` | local | `WaitForVBlank()` was a stub printing a FIXME and returning `E_NOTIMPL` immediately. JUCE 8's Direct2D renderer drives all repainting from a dedicated thread that calls it in a loop, so with no wait that thread spun — measured at 62,024 calls in ~25 s, saturating a core — and the editor rendered one frame then never responded to input again. Now sleeps to the next refresh-interval boundary. Not Haiku-specific: the same gap is why these plug-ins are reported as needing DXVK on Linux, DXVK shipping its own DXGI with a real vblank wait. |
| 10 | sechost: report no failure actions in `QueryServiceConfig2W` | local | `services.exe` keeps no failure actions, and `QueryServiceConfig2W` failed with `ERROR_INVALID_LEVEL` for them. WiX's ServiceConfig custom action (used by iLok's PACE License Support installer) reads them before setting them and aborts the whole install when the query fails. Now reports what Windows reports for a service with none: the structure, zeroed. Not Haiku-specific; carried from the user's ARM64 Wine build. |
| 11 | msiexec, rundll32: declare Windows 10 compatibility in their manifests | local | Without a `supportedOS` list, Wine reports Windows 8 to the process an MSI custom action runs in, as Windows does. Installers that check for Windows 10 there (iLok's PACE License Support) refuse to install. Adds the same list Windows' own `msiexec.exe`/`rundll32.exe` carry. Not Haiku-specific; carried from the user's ARM64 Wine build. On a stock Haiku kernel these two only help 64-bit installers, since 32-bit Windows programs need patch 15 and a kernel with LDT support. |
| 12 | server: detach asyncs from a queue before terminating them in `free_async_queue()` | local | wineserver aborted (`release_object: obj->refcount`) every time a prefix shut down, so registry changes since the last 30-second periodic save were lost — `wine regedit file.reg` never persisted, which broke licences kept in the registry (MachineGuid, per-plugin IDs) — and each crash orphaned the prefix's `services.exe`. When an APC cannot be delivered, `async_terminate()` completes the async through `async_set_result()`, which unlinked it and dropped the queue's reference while `free_async_queue()` still held it, and `free_async_queue()` then dropped it again. On Haiku delivery always fails for a thread not already waiting, because the client reports no Unix thread id (`get_unix_tid()` returns -1) and wineserver cannot signal it; `services.exe` closing its listening `svcctl` pipe at shutdown hits this every time. Not Haiku-specific in itself. |
| 13 | ntdll, server: deliver signals to specific threads on Haiku | local | `get_unix_tid()` had no Haiku branch and returned -1, so wineserver could never signal one thread: an APC queued to a thread that was not already waiting was destroyed and the pending I/O completed with `STATUS_ALERTED`. Named-pipe readers saw `ERROR_ALERTED` — WiX Burn's engine and UI lost their pipe (`0x800702e3`). Reports `find_thread(NULL)` and signals with `send_signal()`. Also removes the trigger of patch 12's crash. |
| 14 | winegcc: do not link with `-ldl` on Haiku | local | Haiku has no `libdl` (`dlopen` is in libroot), so every Winelib link failed unless a hand-made empty `libdl.a` stub was installed. |
| 15 | ntdll: support WoW64 (32-bit code) on Haiku | local | 32-bit Windows code needs a 32-bit code selector and a per-thread `%fs` segment for its TEB; every 32-bit program exited with "No LDT support on this platform". Uses new `arch_thread_control()` calls (`THREAD_SET_LDT_ENTRY`, `THREAD_SET/GET_FS_BASE`, `THREAD_GET_GS_BASE`) that **only a locally built Haiku kernel provides** (per-team LDT, FS/DS/ES kept per thread, FS saved across signals); FreeBSD's model. On a stock kernel 32-bit programs exit with "No LDT support in this Haiku kernel" and 64-bit ones are unaffected. Enables the iLok PACE installer's 32-bit parts (Bonjour, custom actions) and 32-bit installers in general. |
| 16 | ntdll, server: use the xattr functions from libgnu on Haiku | local | Patch 2 disabled `HAVE_SYS_XATTR_H`, so reparse points (Windows symbolic links) failed with `ENOSYS`. Wine Mono's installer creates symlinks (`CREATELINKS64`, error 1603), so Mono never installed and every .NET custom action failed — iLok's License Support MSI with `0x80070643`. configure now finds `fgetxattr` in libgnu, which maps xattrs to BFS attributes. |
| 17 | ntdll, server: support hardware breakpoints on Haiku | local | Copy protection (PACE/iLok: Neural DSP, Toontrack and others) points Dr0–Dr3 at a probe with `SetThreadContext` and expects `EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP` when it runs; a probe that does not trap marks the process as tampered and the licence check fails later ("no activation", or `LoadLibraryW` "DLL initialization failed" for a plug-in). The server cannot set debug registers on Haiku (no ptrace), so each thread loads its own through `THREAD_SET_DEBUG_REGISTERS`, which **only the locally built Haiku kernel provides**; `trap_handler` reports DR6 with the reserved bits set, as Windows does, which PACE checks. On a stock kernel the breakpoints are ignored with a warning. (Developed as "patch 18"; an SMBIOS patch numbered 17 was dropped because it changed the hardware IDs licences are bound to.) |

Patch 7 removes the need for the `export WINELOADER=/boot/system/bin/wine` workaround earlier
Haiku Wine builds required in `~/config/settings/profile`: winegcc's generated `.exe` wrapper
scripts fall back to invoking a bare `wine`, which now works from any directory.

### Dropped in the 11.19 rebase

- **Define `get_current_thread_data`** (Peppersawce) — upstream Wine made the function
  unconditional in wine-11.11, so the patch has nothing left to do.
- **ntdll: debug — name the faulting caller by scanning the stack** — development
  instrumentation from the 11.8 GL work, never a fix. It printed to stdout on every fault.

### Status of the OSMesa backend (patch 8)

**On Wine 11.19 this backend has not run yet.** Wine 11.19 changed the GL driver interface
(version 37 to 41): contexts are now created and owned by the driver, win32u creates the
window's client surface itself, and drivers must supply a null surface for internal contexts
and a thread-cleanup hook. Patch 8 was ported to that interface and compiles against the 11.19
headers, but every gate below must be re-run on an 11.19 build before it is called working.
The port also fixes a known 11.8 bug: resizing a window used to reallocate the render buffer
in place while an OSMesa context was still bound to it.

On Wine 11.8 it was confirmed working for the case it was written for: without it the
Nembrini Audio VST3 editors did not display, with it they did. Rendering held from 11.8
REVISION 6; from REVISION 8, which added the dxgi patch, those editors were also interactive.

Against the five gates in [docs/OSMESA-GL-PLAN.md](docs/OSMESA-GL-PLAN.md) §5, **as last
measured on Wine 11.8**:

| Gate | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — standalone `osprobe` shows GL 4.5 / llvmpipe | **passing** |
| 2 — Wine GL smoke test (`wglCreateContext`, `glGetString`) | never run as a discrete test; entailed by 3–5 passing |
| 3 — wined3d creates a device against llvmpipe | **passing** — the old `wined3d_caps_gl_ctx_create Failed to find a suitable pixel format` is gone |
| 4 — rendered frame reaches the floating Wayland window | **passing** — editors display and are usable; no formal colour/orientation check was performed |
| 5 — NA VST3 in jackDAW: D3D GUI renders **and is interactive** | **passing, 2026-07-27** (REVISION 8) |
| 5b — repeated open/close of an editor leaves `jackd` and jackDAW running | **passing, 2026-07-27** — the forced-restart symptom is gone |

Gate 2 is the only one never exercised on its own, so a regression in the raw WGL path would
first surface as a failure in one of the gates below it rather than as a clear GL error.

The verified groundwork, and why the alternatives (DXVK/Vulkan WSI, porting Mesa's
Wayland-EGL platform) are dead ends on Haiku, is all in that document.

Patch 8 is gated at build time on `HAVE_OSMESA`, which `configure` derives from `GL/osmesa.h`
plus `libOSMesa`. **If those are missing the port still builds — silently, without software
GL**, falling back to the EGL path that cannot work on Haiku. The recipe now declares
`devel:libOSMesa` and `lib:libOSMesa` so this cannot happen by accident; it did not before
REVISION 7.

### Optional patches

`patches/wine-11.8-home.patchset` (Peppersawce, "Move wine dir to `/config/settings`") is
**not** listed in the recipe's `PATCHES` and is not applied. It is upstream's and marked buggy;
kept only so it is not lost.

## Building

On the target Haiku machine, with a [haikuports](https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports)
checkout and `haikuporter` configured:

```sh
# 1. Overlay this port onto your haikuports checkout
cp -a app-emulation/wine/. ~/haikuports/app-emulation/wine/

# 2. Build (roughly an hour; builds both i386 and x86_64)
cd ~/haikuports
haikuporter -y -j8 wine-11.19
```

The package lands in `~/haikuports/packages/wine-11.19-1-x86_64.hpkg`.

> **Always `haikuporter -y -c wine-11.19` first when `REVISION` changed.** Not just when the
> patchset changed — **the revision is compiled into the binaries.** `configure` records
> `prefix = /packages/wine-<version>-<revision>/.self`, and Wine bakes that into `bindir`/
> `libdir`; the loader then resolves `ntdll.so` through it. Skipping `-c` after only a recipe
> edit re-runs `configure` (so the `Makefile` says the new revision) but recompiles nothing,
> because no source changed — and the package ships binaries still pointing at the **previous**
> revision's package directory.
>
> That package works perfectly on any machine where the old revision is still installed, and
> fails on every machine where it is not, with:
>
> ```
> wine: could not load ntdll.so: No such file or directory
> runtime_loader: Cannot open file /packages/wine-11.8-8/.self/lib/wine/x86_64-unix/ntdll.so
> ```
>
> Diagnose it directly — the shipped binary disagrees with the recipe:
>
> ```sh
> strings -a /boot/system/bin/wine | grep packages/wine   # must match the installed revision
> ```
>
> A tell-tale sign is a suspiciously fast rebuild and binaries whose hashes are *identical* to
> the previous revision's. That is not reassurance that the payload is unchanged; it is the
> symptom.

Build dependencies are declared in the recipe (`BUILD_REQUIRES`/`BUILD_PREREQUIRES`) and include
llvm21 + clang + lld for the PE cross-build; `haikuporter` will tell you what is missing.

### Iterating without an hour-long rebuild

A clean rebuild is ~55 minutes, which is not a per-edit cycle. Two things make a fast loop
possible:

- `haikuporter` applies `.patchset` files **with git**, so `work-11.19/sources/wine-wine-11.19`
  is a git repo whose `HEAD` is the pristine tarball plus these patches. Editing it and
  rebuilding one target inside the chroot (`haikuporter -E wine-11.19`, then
  `make -j8 dlls/dxgi/dxgi.dll`) takes minutes, and `git diff` there is exactly your change.
- Nothing needs to be installed to test it. Wine sets its internal `build_dir` when its
  `ntdll.so` sits under `<tree>/dlls/ntdll`, and then omits the installed `/boot/system/lib/wine`
  from the DLL search path entirely — so the build tree wins outright:

  ```sh
  export WINELOADER=<work tree>/loader/wine
  ```

  (`WINEDLLPATH` does *not* work for this: its entries are appended *after* the installed
  directory, so an installed builtin always wins.)

> **The catch: `haikuporter -c` deletes `work-11.19/sources/` without warning.** An edit that
> exists only there is one command from being lost — that has happened twice here. Replay every
> such edit into the patchset (`git diff` in the work tree, apply it to the tree the patchset is
> generated from) *before* any clean rebuild. Every source change ultimately belongs in the
> patchset — see below.

### Installing

```sh
pkgman install ./wine-11.19-4-x86_64.hpkg
```

- **x86_64**, and **Haiku nightly hrev60247 or newer** (REVISION 3 is built on hrev60247).
  `haikuporter` bakes the build machine's revision in as a floor, so an older nightly — and R1
  beta stable — refuses to install it. Newer is fine — this is a userland package, not a kernel
  add-on.
- Runtime dependencies, all pulled from HaikuPorts automatically. If the target machine is
  offline, bring them along too.

  | Declared since | Resolvable | Package |
  |---|---|---|
  | always | `lib:libfreetype` | `freetype` |
  | always | `lib:libvulkan` | `vulkan` |
  | REVISION 7 | `lib:libOSMesa` | `mesa` |
  | **REVISION 10** | `lib:libwayland_client`, `lib:libwayland_egl` | `wayland` |
  | **REVISION 10** | `lib:libxkbcommon`, `lib:libxkbregistry` | `libxkbcommon` |
  | **REVISION 10** | `lib:wayland_server_inproc` | `wayland_server` |
  | **REVISION 10**, corrected | `lib:libusb_1.0` | `libusb` |

  (Written for REVISION 9, but 9 was withdrawn before it ever worked — see the revision
  history. REVISION 10 is the first package that actually ships them.)

  The last row was `lib:libusb` through REVISION 8, which resolves to `libusb_compat` — the
  libusb-0.1 API. `wineusb.so` links `libusb-1.0.so.0`, provided by the `libusb` package as
  `lib:libusb_1.0`. Nothing in the port links libusb-0.1 at all, so the old entry pulled in a
  library no module used while leaving the one `wineusb.so` needs undeclared.

**REVISION 8 and earlier declared none of the Wayland ones, and that made the package
un-GUI-able on a machine that did not already have them.** `winewayland.so` links
`libwayland-client`, `libwayland-egl`, `libxkbcommon` and `libxkbregistry` directly
(`objdump -p` shows them as `NEEDED`), and a Haiku recipe's `REQUIRES` is hand-written —
nothing scans the binaries for you. On a machine with those libraries already installed for
other reasons the package worked; on a clean one it installed happily and then had no display
driver. See *Graphics driver* below for the failure signature.

If you are stuck on an older package, the missing pieces install by hand:

```sh
pkgman install wayland wayland_server libxkbcommon
```

## Changing a patch

Do not edit the patchset by hand. Rebuild it from a git tree, which is how the current one was
produced:

```sh
# One-time: reconstruct the working tree from this repo
tar xf wine-wine-11.19.tar.gz && cd wine-wine-11.19
git init -q && git add -A && git commit -qm "wine-11.19 pristine"
git am /path/to/haiku-wine-port/app-emulation/wine/patches/wine-11.19.patchset

# Then, for every change: edit, commit, regenerate, commit the patchset here
git format-patch --stdout <pristine-sha>..HEAD \
  > /path/to/haiku-wine-port/app-emulation/wine/patches/wine-11.19.patchset
```

Each commit is one patch, in order. Bump `REVISION` in the recipe whenever the patchset or
recipe changes — never reuse a published revision.

To verify a regenerated patchset reproduces the tree it came from:

```sh
git worktree add --detach /tmp/verify <pristine-sha>
cd /tmp/verify && git am /path/to/patches/wine-11.19.patchset
git rev-parse HEAD^{tree}   # must equal the dev tree's HEAD^{tree}
```

## Where things live

| | Role |
|---|---|
| **this repo** | **Authoritative.** The recipe and patchsets, in git. If it is not committed here, it is not kept. |
| `third_party/wine-haiku-dev` | Scratch working tree for editing source and regenerating the patchset (the `git am` tree above): pristine 11.19 plus one commit per patch. Regenerable; safe to delete and recreate. |
| `third_party/wine-osmesa-dev` | The 11.8 tree the 11.19 rebase cherry-picked from. History only. Tag `pre-consolidate-backup-20260726` marks its pre-cleanup history. |
| build VM `~/haikuports/app-emulation/wine/` | Build machine only (a QEMU VM running the nightly the package is built for). Copy the port in, build, copy the `.hpkg` out. Has no git history of its own — anything edited only there is one `haikuporter -c` from gone. |

## Graphics driver

The port builds `--with-wayland --without-x`. Which driver a prefix uses is set once, per
prefix, in `HKCU\Software\Wine\Drivers\Graphics`, and the right choice depends on what you are
doing:

| Setting | Result |
|---|---|
| `null` | **Use this for plug-ins.** vstbridge captures the plug-in's window and repaints it inside jackDAW's FX window, so the plug-in's own on-screen window is an unwanted duplicate. The `null` driver declines to create a driver window surface, which sends win32u down its offscreen path — the window still draws and still receives `WM_PAINT`, but never reaches a display. |
| `winewayland.drv` (default) | A floating window for any Windows program. For a bridged plug-in you get that floating window *in addition to* the copy in the FX window. Keep this if the prefix also runs ordinary Windows applications, since `null` leaves those with no window at all. |

```sh
wine reg add 'HKCU\Software\Wine\Drivers' /v Graphics /d null /f
```

vstbridge logs a warning naming the current driver whenever it is not `null`.

Note that patch 8's software GL lives in `winewayland.drv`, so it is only in play when that
driver is selected — the `null` driver has no GL backend at all.

### How a Wayland window exists on Haiku at all

There is no compositor process. The `wayland_server` package installs exactly one file,
`lib/wayland-server-inproc.so` (`package list -p`), and `libwayland-client` loads it at runtime:
the library imports `dlopen`/`dlsym`, carries the literal string `wayland-server-inproc.so`, and
does **not** list it in `NEEDED`. Haiku's Wayland is X512's fork
(`github.com/X547/wayland`), and its server port describes itself as an add-on that "does not
run as a separate server process but loads as an add-on into each Wayland client instead …
uses existing Haiku capabilities such as native Haiku windows and bitmap drawing API".

That is why `ps` shows nothing compositor-shaped and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is unset, yet a plug-in
editor still gets a real floating window.

It is also why the dependency is easy to miss. `wayland` does not require `wayland_server`, and
neither did this port before REVISION 9. On the build laptop the only installed package that
requires `lib:wayland_server_inproc` is **`gtk3`** — so the in-process compositor was present
there by coincidence, dragged in behind some unrelated GTK application, and every Wine GUI test
to date silently depended on it.

### When no driver loads at all

`explorer.exe` picks the driver by calling `LoadLibraryW("winewayland.drv")` and writing the
result to `GraphicsDriver` under `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Video\{guid}\0000`
(`programs/explorer/desktop.c:998,1037,1063`). If the load fails it writes `DriverError`
instead (`desktop.c:1066`), and `win32u` falls back to a null driver whose `nodrv_CreateWindow`
fails **every** window creation after logging one line (`dlls/win32u/driver.c:762-774`):

```
err:winediag:nodrv_CreateWindow Application tried to create a window, but no driver could be loaded.
err:winediag:nodrv_CreateWindow L"Make sure that your display server is running and that its variables are set."
```

What this looks like from the outside is *not* a crash:

- Wine runs and `wine --version` works.
- A bridged plug-in scans and loads, and appears in jackDAW's FX window list — but opening its
  editor shows nothing.
- **The "The Wine configuration in ... is being updated, please wait..." dialog never appears on
  first run.** That text is `IDD_WAITDLG`, a dialog resource (`programs/wineboot/wineboot.rc:45`),
  so it is the first casualty. Its absence on a fresh prefix is the cleanest early signal that no
  display driver loaded.

  **The prefix is still created correctly** — the dialog is decorative.
  `update_wineprefix()` does its work in `rundll32` child processes and waits on the *process*
  handle, not the window; `show_wait_window()`'s return value is never checked, and
  `install_root_pnp_devices()` and `update_user_profile()` run afterwards regardless
  (`programs/wineboot/wineboot.c:1511-1516,1660-1690`). So there is no need to delete and
  recreate `~/.wine` after installing the missing packages.

To confirm on a suspect machine:

```sh
objdump -p /boot/system/lib/wine/x86_64-unix/winewayland.so | grep NEEDED   # what it wants
wine reg query 'HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Video' /s | grep -i driver
WINEDEBUG=+winediag wine notepad 2>&1 | head       # the ERR above, if any
```

## Revision history

### wine-11.19

| REVISION | Notes |
|---|---|
| 4 | Patch 17 (hardware breakpoints, for PACE/iLok copy protection), and `lib:libgnutls` in REQUIRES: Wine dlopens it, so haikuporter could not see the dependency, and without it TLS (and iLok sign-in) failed. Patch 17 was verified from the work tree on hrev60247: the Windows breakpoint tests pass, and the Fortin NTS and Archetype Gojira X VST3s load licensed in JackDAW. The patchset applies to pristine 11.19 and gives tree `26fbb2d8`. **Not yet built as a package.** |
| 3 | Patches 13–16: thread-directed signals, no `-ldl` in winegcc, WoW64 (32-bit code) on a kernel with LDT support, xattrs through libgnu. Built on hrev60247, so it requires `haiku>=r1~beta6_hrev60247-1`. Verified with the work tree before packaging (VM, custom hrev60247 kernel): a 32-bit `syswow64\cmd.exe` runs and reports `x86`; Wine Mono 11.3.0 installs; iLok's PACE License Support bundle installs (exit `0x0`) and iLok License Manager starts. **Built** 2026-10-15 with `haikuporter -c`: the work tree's `HEAD^{tree}` equals the verified patchset's (`3035eeed`); `config.h` has `HAVE_SYS_XATTR_H 1` and the Makefile `XATTR_LIBS = -lgnu`; `ntdll.so` and `wineserver` link `libgnu.so`; `bin/wine` carries `/packages/wine-11.19-3`; the package requires `haiku>=r1~beta6_hrev60247-1`. **Not yet run as an installed package or on the test machine.** |
| 2 | Patch 12 (wineserver `free_async_queue()` double release). Built on hrev60236. |
| 1 | Rebase onto Wine 11.19 (tarball SHA256 `73eb0b02…c4087f`). Eleven patches: the 11.8 set minus `get_current_thread_data` (upstreamed in 11.11) and the debug stack scan, plus two installer fixes for iLok/PACE (sechost failure actions, Windows 10 manifests for msiexec/rundll32). Patch 2 needed two conflict resolutions; the OSMesa backend (patch 8) was ported to the version-41 GL driver interface and compile-checked only. Dependency declarations unchanged from 11.8-10. **Built** on hrev60236 (2026-10-14), after one more patch 2 fix: 11.19 adds a static `spawn_thread()` to `dlls/ntdll/unix/thread.c` that clashes with Haiku's `OS.h`, so it is renamed around that include like `cpu_info` and `exit_thread`. Confirmed in the build: `HAVE_OSMESA 1` in the work tree's `config.h`; the package requires `haiku>=r1~beta6_hrev60236-1` and `lib:libosmesa`; `bin/wine` carries `/packages/wine-11.19-1/.self`. In 11.19, `bin/wine` is a small launcher (`tools/wine`), and the loader that patch 7 changes is `lib/wine/x86_64-unix/Wine`, which imports `find_path`. **Not yet run on a test machine.** |

### wine-11.8

| REVISION | Notes |
|---|---|
| 10 | **The Wayland dependency fix, rebuilt cleanly.** Same recipe content as 9 apart from the revision; the patchset is still byte-identical to REVISION 8. Exists only because 9 was built without `haikuporter -c` and shipped binaries carrying REVISION 8's package path — a revision cannot be reissued once installed anywhere, since `pkgman` keys upgrades off version-revision and would see a same-named package as nothing new. Before shipping, confirm `strings -a /boot/system/bin/wine \| grep packages/wine` reports `wine-11.8-10`. |
| 9 | **Withdrawn — never worked on any machine that did not already have REVISION 8 installed. Do not use.** Recipe only; the patchset is byte-identical to REVISION 8. First built 2026-07-28 *without* `haikuporter -c` (~17 min); that package was **broken** and had to be rebuilt cleanly. Because no source changed, `make` recompiled nothing, so the binaries kept REVISION 8's compiled-in `/packages/wine-11.8-8/.self` prefix while the recipe said 9. It ran fine on the build laptop, where wine-11.8-8 was still installed, and died on a machine that had only 11.8-9 with `wine: could not load ntdll.so` — which surfaced as VST plug-ins silently failing to list, because vstbridge's scan helper aborts on empty `wine --version` output. See the warning under *Building*: a `REVISION` bump alone requires a clean build. `package list -i` on the `.hpkg` confirms the new `requires:` set, including `lib:libusb_1.0>=0.3.0` replacing `lib:libusb>=0.1.7`. Declares the runtime dependencies `winewayland.so` actually links (`lib:libwayland_client`, `lib:libwayland_egl`, `lib:libxkbcommon`, `lib:libxkbregistry`) plus `lib:wayland_server_inproc` for Haiku's in-process compositor, and corrects `lib:libusb` to `lib:libusb_1.0`. Found when REVISION 8 was installed on a second Haiku machine: it installed cleanly, bridged plug-ins fine, and had no GUI at all, because none of those packages were present and nothing had declared them. The build laptop happened to have them via `gtk3`. See *Installing* and *Graphics driver*. |
| 8 | Adds patch 10 (`dxgi: WaitForVBlank`). Built on the laptop 2026-07-27 (hrev59899, `EXIT=0`, `HAVE_OSMESA 1` confirmed in the work tree's `config.h`). **Observed working:** Direct3D-drawn plug-in editors — Nembrini Audio VST3s under vstbridge in jackDAW — became interactive; before this they rendered one frame and ignored all mouse and keyboard input, including clicks delivered straight to the floating Wayland window. Also folds in REVISION 7's OSMesa dependency declarations, which were never built on their own. |
| 7 | Declares `devel:libOSMesa` / `lib:libOSMesa`. Same sources as 6. **Never built** — superseded by 8 before a package was produced. Verification checklist retained because it has not been performed: after install, verify in order: (a) `/boot/system/bin/wine --version` prints `wine-11.8`; (b) `objdump -T /boot/system/bin/wine \| grep find_path` shows the import — **REV6 shipped without patch 08 compiled in**, so a bare `wine` from PATH failed with `could not load ntdll.so` and needed a `WINELOADER`+`WINEDLLPATH` workaround in `~/config/settings/profile`; (c) a bare `wine --version` works. Only then drop the profile workaround. (`find_path(B_FIND_PATH_IMAGE_PATH)` is verified working on hrev59899, so patch 08 is the fix once actually built in.) |
| 6 | Built on the laptop 2026-07-24; the last package before 8. Its sources are what patches 1–9 and 11 now reproduce — patch 10 is new in REVISION 8. The OSMesa pixel-format fix and the stack scanner had been hand-edited into the build work tree and existed in no patchset until this repo captured them. |
| 3–5 | Superseded. |

## Attic

- `winehaiku.drv-11.8-abandoned.patch` — an in-tree Haiku graphics driver tried during
  development and **abandoned**; it did not work. Deliberately not part of the port. The
  arrangement that does work is *Graphics driver* above.
- `wine-7.1.recipe`, `wine-7.1.patchset` — X512's original Wine 7.1 Haiku port (13 patches),
  the ancestor of this work. Reference only.

## Licensing and credit

Wine is **LGPL v2.1**; these patches are derived work under the same licence. Patches 1–4 are
upstream HaikuPorts' work (including X512's Haiku port) with authorship preserved in each
`From:` line. The recipe is derived from the haikuports `app-emulation/wine` recipe.
